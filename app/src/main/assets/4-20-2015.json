[The last time we sold this DJI Phantom 1 Quadcopter](https://meh.com/forum/topics/dji-phantom-1-quadcopter-with-gopro-mount), they not only flew off the shelves (LMAO), they also attracted the attention of some quadcopter frea- er, obsessi- er, mania- ah, screw it, freaks who shared their hacks for pimping their rides in our forum.\r\n\r\nWhich gives us an idea to set up [a forum topic for people who wanna talk all things drone](https://meh.com/forum/topics/official-drone-talk-thread-deals-advice-cameras-flying-tips--more). Not just the drones that pop up in our daily deals - all drones from everywhere. Ask questions, show off your amazing mods, screen your aerial cam epics, post links to drone deals elsewhere. Get droney up in this mug.\r\n\r\nIf you're an addictive personality, walk away right now. But if you think you're ready for this heli, you're just a click of the \"Buy It\" button away from getting your fix. The DJI Phantom 1 is what most amateur drone pilots fly to earn their wings. It's the quadcopter that puts light unmanned aircraft within reach of the common man. (Financially within reach, not physically, necessarily, unless that common man is uncommonly tall.) If you're going to buy a quadcopter, and you don't want to spend the rest of your life parsing spec lists, play it safe with the DJI Phantom 1.\r\n\r\nIt flies for 15 minutes on a charge, hits top speeds of 22mph, and has a GoPro camera mount for stunning your friends with kick-ass aerial video. If you need more convincing that quadcoptering is the hobby for you, well, we know [a place where drone geeks will tell you all about it](https://meh.com/forum/topics/official-drone-talk-thread-deals-advice-cameras-flying-tips--more)."
