            "body": "2015 will be the year you take the first step toward energy independence. (Or second step, if you already have a solar calculator.) \"Right now I'm running on a mixture of grid electricity and solar,\" you can legitimately say, with a mixture of scorn and pity for your less progressive friends. \r\n\r\n\"But hey, that's just me,\" you continue, the very image of a serene, saintly citizen of Spaceship Earth. \"*I* would prefer *not* to annihilate all life on the planet to provide myself with a few moments of artificial comfort. But I don't expect everyone to have already attained this level of enlightenment.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt this kind of shaming will inspire your audience into action, to immediately find ways to emulate your example. At least, you assume that's why they're all running off. But who needs them anyway? You've got everything you need: Father Sun, Mother Earth, and your ReVIVE Solar Panel Power Bank.\r\n\r\nNo, not a solar array on your roof. That shit's expensive. Just one of these little solar-powered phone chargers. Leave it in sunshine for a mere 4-6 hours and it'll soak up enough of Sol's terrible fury to... uh, charge your phone, maybe even your tablet. \r\n\r\nOK, so it's not exactly cold fusion. It'd probably be easier to just charge the power bank via USB and use it like a regular non-solar backup battery. But really, that's how energy use changes: bit by bit, one calculator or lightbulb or phone charger at a time. And hey, if you charge it through USB most of the time, well, your friends don't need to know that. It's still more solar than *their* phone chargers."
