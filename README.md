#Building
You will need to generate your own API key from [meh](https://meh.com/forum/topics/meh-api) and add it to your gradle.properties file (create one in your home directory, under .gradle). You will also need to create an API key for the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/) if you want videos to show up while you are building.

#Contribution
Pull requests are welcomed and encouraged. If you experience any bugs, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Jawnnypoo/open-meh/issues/new)
